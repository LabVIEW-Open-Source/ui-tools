Description:

This package contains tools for designing user interfaces.

A first palette helps create special effects using transparency of front panel. Using them allows to quickly create fade-ins or outs using linear or exponential variation of the intensity.
A second palette contains VIs to calculate the position of GObjects for many purposes like alignment, snap, mouse follow, etc.
A third palette contains VIs to create dialog boxes based on class instances. "Simple Error Dialog" and "Simple Selection List" are featured with or without backrground blackening effect.
A fourth palette includes some VIs to move objects programmatically on the front panel, using a basic deceleration algorithm to provide an impression of a smooth movement.
The packaged VIs are all namespaced using a suffix “__lava_lib_ui_tools” which should not conflict with any of your own code.

Includes:

Front Panel Transparency (Fade In & Fade Out)
Utilities (Alignment, Snap)
Dialog (OOP based, extensible)
Engine (Beta) for object movement
